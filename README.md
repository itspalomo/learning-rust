Learning rust based on https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/.
To start learning Rust using the official book, you can follow this detailed plan:

1. **Install Rust**: Begin by installing Rust on your machine. Visit the official Rust website at [https://www.rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Read "The Rust Programming Language"**: The official book, also known as the Rust Book, is an excellent resource for learning Rust. You can access it online at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Start by reading the first few chapters to get a solid understanding of the language's fundamentals.

3. **Work on Hands-on Exercises**: As you progress through the book, make sure to actively engage with the material by working on the hands-on exercises provided. These exercises will help reinforce your understanding of the concepts and give you practical experience with Rust.

4. **Join the Rust Community**: Rust has a vibrant and supportive community. Joining the community can provide you with valuable resources, help, and opportunities to collaborate with other Rust developers. Consider joining the official Rust Discord server, participating in forums like [https://users.rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org), and following Rust-related blogs and podcasts.

5. **Explore Additional Resources**: While the official book is comprehensive, there are other resources available to deepen your understanding of Rust. Some recommended resources include:

    - **Rust by Example**: [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) provides hands-on examples to further solidify your knowledge.

    - **Rust Cookbook**: [https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) offers practical examples and solutions to common programming tasks in Rust.

    - **Rust API Documentation**: The official Rust documentation at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) provides detailed information about the Rust standard library and its APIs.

    - **Rust Playground**: [https://play.rust-lang.org/](https://play.rust-lang.org/) is an online platform where you can experiment with Rust code without needing to set up a local development environment.

Remember to practice regularly, build small projects, and seek help from the community whenever you encounter challenges. Happy learning!
